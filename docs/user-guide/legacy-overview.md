# Path Header Scanner

Path Header Scanner is a developer utility used to automatically:

- insert missing path headers
- validate existing headers
- replace invalid headers
- normalize relative file path visibility

The project is designed for:

- local development
- Docker workflows
- CI/CD pipelines
- multi-language repositories

---

# Example

Example generated header:

```python
# app/core/scanner.py
```

Example source file:

```python
# app/core/scanner.py

class FileScanner:
    ...
```

# Include / Exclude Target Directory

The scanner supports configurable header generation.

---

# Include Target Directory

Default behavior:

```python
# app/cli/main.py
```

Example:

```bash
path-header-scanner scan app \
    --include-target-directory
```

---

# Exclude Target Directory

Example:

```python
# cli/main.py
```

Command:

```bash
path-header-scanner scan app \
    --exclude-target-directory
```

---

# Command Overview

Main command:

```bash
path-header-scanner scan TARGET_DIRECTORY
```

---

# Common Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--apply` | Write changes to files |
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging |
| `--workdir` | Custom working directory |
| `--include-target-directory` | Include scan target in headers |
| `--exclude-target-directory` | Exclude scan target from headers |

# Notes

- Paths use POSIX separators.
- Docker workflows support mounted workspaces.
- Existing special lines are preserved safely.
- File updates preserve trailing newlines.
- Relative path generation is configurable.
